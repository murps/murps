    <h1>MURPS</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <h2>Minimalist</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to provide an intuitive and elegant core system that you read once and never have need to refer to again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <h2>Universal</h2>
        <p>By focusing on chance and organizational mechanics, our system is not biased toward a particular setting or genre.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <h2>Role-Playing</h2>
        <p>The most memorable moments of table top gaming happen during great role playing and MURPS is designed to incentivize that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <h2>System</h2>
        <p>MURPS core is designed to be a solid foundation to build upon and extend as-needed by your group's gaming style and setting.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Six-sided dice</h2>
        <p>Plain 'ol six-sided die that you'd find in many existing board games will do just fine. A single die will suffice, though three per person is recommended.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Pencil &amp; Paper</h2>
        <p>Not a single seasoned adventurer would rely solely on their mind to keep track of important events and details. Why should you?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Narrator</h2>
        <p>A person identified to keep the story progressing. He or she has the final say in all disputes. The narrator role-plays any character outside of the adventure party.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Players</h2>
        <p>Anyone that is role playing a character (or characters) in the adventure party. For best results, remember to make decisions and act based on your character's traits and knowledge instead of your own.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>Characters should be just as dynamic as people you might come across in real life. Therefore, not all characters are going to have memorable traits in every category of a cookie-cutter character sheet. The Narrator and Players should determine what's most important about the characters they are role playing.</p>
        <p>The following categories and questions will help you flesh out your character:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Goals</strong> - What are some of your characters short or long term desires</li>
          <li><strong>Occupation</strong> - What is the everday context in which your character uses their skills</li>
          <li><strong>Secrets</strong> - What is your character hiding from the rest of the party?</li>
          <li><strong>Physical</strong> - What would other characters notice at first glance?</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional</strong> - How does your character react to different situations?</li>
          <li><strong>Lineage</strong> - How might your characters family history affect their life?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any notable equipment a character has should be recorded with their traits as well.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Chance</h2>
        <p>For any action that has a consequence (as determined by the Narrator) you roll a die (or dice) to determine the outcome. First, discuss the situational advantages and disadvantages that would affect the likelihood of success for the task at hand.</p>
        <p>Once the Narrator accepts the current list of advantages and disadvantages, the difference between the two lists determines the number of dice to add to the roll. Whichever list had the most items, determines the type of roll (a tie results in a roll with a single die):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Advantage</strong> - Roll X die and use the "best" roll</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage</strong> - Roll X die and use the "worst" roll</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All success roles are "better" than failure rolls:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p><strong>Success</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6</strong> Critical - You succeed <strong>and</strong> then some</li>
          <li><strong>4</strong> Normal - You succeed</li>
          <li><strong>2</strong> Marginal - You succeed <strong>but</strong> with complications</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p><strong>Failure</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5</strong> Marginal - You fail <strong>but</strong> not all is lost</li>
          <li><strong>3</strong> Normal - You fail</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> Critical - You fail <strong>and</strong> then some</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Six-degrees of State</h2>
        <p>All measurements and statuses should be abstracted into six functional degrees of state (similar to the chance rolls). This streamlines gameplay and allows the Narrator to randomize state, as-needed.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p><strong>Health</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unscathed</li>
          <li>Scratched</li>
          <li>Wounded</li>
          <li>Maimed</li>
          <li>Critical</li>
          <li>Dead</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p><strong>Distance (Reach)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grappling</li>
          <li>Arms-length</li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Ranged</li>
          <li>Longshot</li>
          <li>Out-of-sight</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p><strong>Size</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tiny</li>
          <li>Small</li>
          <li>Medium</li>
          <li>Large</li>
          <li>Gigantic</li>
          <li>Collosal</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p><strong>Time of Day</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dawn</li>
          <li>Morning</li>
          <li>Mid-day</li>
          <li>Afternoon</li>
          <li>Dusk</li>
          <li>Night</li>

    <h3>Optional Mechanics</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Whenever the Narrator observes a Player role-playing in a creative or amusing way, he or she may award the Player an Inspiration point (either recorded or in the form of a token). The Narrator could allow Players to redeem Inspiration points for effects that include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Re-Roll</strong> - A Player may re-roll an entire roll outright</li>
          <li><strong>Roll modifier (pool)</strong> - Add or remove a die from the pool</li>
          <li><strong>Roll modifier (result)</strong> - Increase or decrese the roll result by one</li>
          <li><strong>Creative License</strong> - A Player may embelish the current scenario with additional details</li>
        </ul>
